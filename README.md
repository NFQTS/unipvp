# unipvp
IMPORTANT!

This needs a keys.py file with a dictionary (named "keys") of your Twitter API keys to function, as well as an Opensea API key (the Opensea API key is placed in the unipvp.py file because I didn't get around to moving it to the keys file.
The Opensea API key and the functionality it provides can probably be replaced by using the etherscan API but I didn't get around to that.
